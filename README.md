# QR Code Component

This project is a simple QR code component built using plain HTML and CSS. The
goal was to create a clean, responsive layout for displaying a QR code with
minimal styling.

## Why Plain HTML & CSS?

For a small project like this, using React or any other JavaScript framework
would be overkill. HTML and CSS are sufficient to achieve the desired result,
ensuring fast load times and simplicity without unnecessary complexity.
